## 🎮 Overview

This is my first fully finished Unity project, developed independently from concept to final release.  
The goal was to create a complete, stable, and enjoyable game experience while learning core Unity systems such as texture manipulation, UI design, and sound management.

## 📚 Development Highlights

During development, I focused on:
- Ensuring **smooth UI performance** when interacting with UI
- Ease of adding new image collections, and masks for image cutting

Personal discoveries and bigges bugfixes during development:
- Unity Colliders are recreated each frame if you`re moving them using transform. Which can tank performance drasticaly.
- Default SpriteMeshType when creating sprites are Tight. So if you want to add additional pixels to it using shaders be ready to see sprites that look cropped.
- Unity script execution order can have great impact on project.
- Making UI can take a lot of time, especially if you dont want to make it.
